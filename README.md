## About
This module is available on the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/jetrails-jetrails-twofactor.html" ><b>Magento Marketplace</b></a>. The JetRails 2FA plugin adds an extra layer of security to your Magento store.  User-based 2FA enablement ensures that admin users are following best security practices. This module has the following features:

- A Master Administrator can require 2FA to be utilized by specific users.
- Usage of 2FA can be enforced and required for log in.
- Once you use the 2FA to log in, there is an option to bypass authentication for a pre-configured number of days.
- A Master Administrator can oversee every user's authentication process.
- In the event of a lost or misplaced 2FA account, backup codes are available as an alternate method for authentication.
- In the event of an attempted account breach, prevention protocols are in place via brute-force protection, which will temporarily block the account.
- The threshold for the number of failed authentication attempts before a temporary ban is imposed is configurable.
- The duration of a user's temporary ban is configurable.
- An automatic instantaneous alert will be sent to the account owner and store admins informing them of an attempted breach. Any security warning will be logged with any relevant data such as the offender's IP address.
- The 2FA account can be setup for devices (something they have) using the Google Authenticator app, which is available for every platform including <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" >iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2" >Android</a>.

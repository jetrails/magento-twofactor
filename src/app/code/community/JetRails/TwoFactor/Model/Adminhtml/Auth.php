	 * Auth.php - This authentication model class is very important because it interfaces with the
	 * authentication resource model and is a mediator that encrypts and decrypts data.  It also has
	 * useful methods that determine if a ban on a user is expired, does the authentication on a
	 * passed TOTP pin, and registers failed authentication attempts.  In addition the constants
	 * that are defined within this class are used throughout the module and are accessed
	 * statically.
